# Weather-webApp-using-APIs
This is a web page created using several APIs on weather prediction, Solar UV information, and pollution prediction. 
The focus of this project was on distributed developement and utilising Software as a service archiecture.
Will not likley work if downloaded & tested due to the configurations of the server that one would need to have a vpn to access to reference the hosted versions of each service. I will not be updating this project further thought it would be trival to make it locally hosted instead.

Created with Visual Studio 2022

Example of how the program looks ([x] means that these would be loaded using API calls who's implmentation is also listed in the project):
